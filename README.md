# Rust Sauerbraten Port

This project is a Rust port of the dwclassic game Sauerbraten. The main purpose of this project is to serve as a learning platform for Rust enthusiasts, including myself, and potentially assist others in their Rust learning journey.

## About Sauerbraten

Sauerbraten is a popular first-person shooter (FPS) game known for its fast-paced gameplay and unique map editing capabilities. By creating a Rust port of this game, we aim to explore the power and versatility of Rust while paying homage to a gaming classic.

## Learning Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that offers memory safety, concurrency, and performance. By working on this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of Rust's features and best practices. We welcome contributors and learners to join us in this educational adventure.

Let's embark on this Rust journey together!
